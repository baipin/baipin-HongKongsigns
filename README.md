## Introduction


This is a repository for Cities:skylines 2 mod: Hong Kong Signs [Write Everywhere]


![Screenshots_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdec1cd4-734d-4c04-89f8-7f94debb4bc2)

### Outdtanding Features
* Combined with a free Chinese font ("滙文港黑"), supporting Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English. You don't need to import font by yourself.
* Covering various kinds of traffic signs in Hong Kong, and it can also be used as UK signs pack.
* **Non-illustration Traffic Bollard (NRTB, 安全島反光板)** is included, and it's very realistic!
* **Very convenient to use.** The template is already there, and you just need to change the texts.
* **Special signs for Right-hand traffic.** I specially made new signs for RHT! So if your city is in RHT, you can also use the signs realistically!

## Download
You can download from [Paradox Mods Platform](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/125896/Windows).

If you cannot conntect to Paradox mod, you can also download from the [Release](https://github.com/baipin/HongKongsigns/releases) Page, but I cannot guarantee it is the latest. Generally, I will upload to the release page when it's a phased stable version.

## Important: After adding to playset...
You need to import Chinese font included in the mod by yourself. But it is very easy, just do like this:  
* Enter your savegame.
* Click the Write Everywhere buttom on the left-top (A circled "W").
* Choose "CITY FONTS" tab.
* Click "+", choose the puzzle-piece icon (Templates from mods). And search for the "baipinHongKongsigns" Mod.  
* Select "Huiwenganghei.ttf", click "OK".
* You are done!
